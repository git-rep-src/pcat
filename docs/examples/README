/examples/scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are a set of small scripts to further demonstrate some

such as in "http-proxy", if your proxy server requires authorization,
you'll have to add your own authorization information.


/examples/logs/
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are a set of output logfiles generated by Pcat to briefly
demonstrate Pcat's logging abilities.
